    Fixed issue where the method :meth:`.EnvironmentContext.get_x_argument`
    using the :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.get_x_argument.as_dictionary`
    parameter would fail if an argument key were passed on the command line as
    a name alone, that is, without an equal sign ``=`` or a value. Behavior is
    repaired where this condition is detected and will return a blank string
    for the given key, consistent with the behavior where the ``=`` sign is
    present and no value.  Pull request courtesy Iuri de Silvio.
