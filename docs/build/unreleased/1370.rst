    Fixed issue where ``get_x_arguments(as_dictionary=True)`` would fail if an
    argument key were passed without an equal sign ``=`` or a value.
    Behavior is repaired where this condition is detected and will return a
    blank string for the given key, consistent with the behavior where the
    ``=`` sign is present and no value.  Pull request courtesy Iuri de Silvio.
